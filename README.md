# Symfony ToDo List Project

This Symfony project implements a simple ToDo list application with session management. The application allows users to add, modify, and delete ToDo items, as well as reset the entire list. The project includes the following key files:

- **TodoController.php:** This controller manages the ToDo list operations including initializing the list, adding, modifying, deleting, and resetting ToDo items.

- **index.html.twig:** The template file for displaying the ToDo list. It iterates through the ToDo items stored in the session and displays them in an ordered list.

- **base.html.twig:** The base template file which includes common HTML structure and Bootstrap for styling. It also handles displaying flash messages for user notifications.

This project demonstrates basic session management, routing, and templating in Symfony. It also incorporates Bootstrap for simple and responsive styling.
